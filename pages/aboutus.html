            <!-- thought this deserved it's own section -->
            <p>
                After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, 
                Matt Cleveland learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time. 
                Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, 
                Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, 
                traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go.
